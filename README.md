# Description

Final project of PHYS 229 at UCB in Spring 2019:

> For your P229 final project I would like you to run the 21cmfast code (https://github.com/andreimesinger/21cmFAST) varying several of its parameters to produce ionization histories.
> Then use CAMB or CLASS (preferred) to compute how the temperature and polarization angular power spectra of the CMB would change if the Universe reionized in this manner.
> You can either submit an iPython notebook or a PDF file describing your results.

[See report here](report.html).
